            <p>Welcome to my profile! I’m Elton, a 21-year-old creator who thrives on designing and expressing my creativity. Here, you’ll find a collection of my sample codes and prototypes, showcasing my journey through the exciting world of technology. Each project reflects my passion for innovation and the artistry behind coding.</p>
            
            <p>In my free time, I love experimenting with fashion and dressing up, as well as singing and playing the guitar. These hobbies inspire my work and allow me to blend technology with my artistic interests. I believe that every line of code tells a story, and I’m excited to share mine with you!</p>
            
            <p>I created this website for my IPT course, where I will showcase some of my works, including source codes, prototypes, and a bit more about myself. I hope you enjoy exploring my creations and learning about my journey in the world of IT!</p>
